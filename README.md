# notes while building FE assignment

1. the AI summary, what happens when we first generate the summary and revisit it later. and shoudn’t the summary be generated and sotred in the backend when the open loop is detected(meaning klaire already know about the open loop and its summary).
2. while using the klaire app, lets say we detect a open loop,how does the user experiece look like of letting the user know. can we add the task directly to the list?( that might cause shift and user might not keep track of it,highligthing of the current task helps, but where does the new task show up.)
3. when do we fetch the task list context( slack threads, notion docs etc). when you fetch the list? when you fetch the task detail?(this might effect how we place loading states and cotent shells).
